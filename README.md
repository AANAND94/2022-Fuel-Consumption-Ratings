# 2022-Fuel-Consumption-Ratings
2022 Fuel Consumption Ratings dataset revealing some key insights about vehicle fuel efficiency and environmental impact.

ðŸš˜ Analysis (CO2 Rating and Smog Rating by Model)
ðŸ”¹Identify Low and High CO2 Emitters - to understand which vehicles are the most and least environmentally friendly.
ðŸ”¹Smog Rating Correlation - to see if models with low CO2 emissions also have low smog ratings. 
ðŸ”¹Top Performers - in both CO2 and smog ratings, indicating high environmental standards.
 
ðŸš˜ Analysis of Fuel Consumption (Combined, City, Highway) by Model
ðŸ”¹Fuel Efficiency Trends - Compare combined, city, and highway fuel consumption for different models.
ðŸ”¹Best and Worst Performers - Highlight models with the best and worst fuel consumption in each category
ðŸ”¹Impact on Environment â€“ correlation of fuel consumption with CO2 emissions and smog ratings to understand the environmental impact.

ðŸš˜ Analysis (Smog Rating by Vehicle Class and Model)
ðŸ”¹Class-Specific Trends - Compare smog ratings to identify which classes tend to have better or worse ratings.
ðŸ”¹Model Comparisons within Classes - to identify the top and bottom-performing models in terms of smog ratings. 

ðŸš˜ Analysis CO2 Emissions and CO2 Rating by Model 
ðŸ”¹Emission Leaders - compare lowest CO2 emissions and their CO2 ratings to highlight leaders in reducing emissions.
ðŸ”¹Rating Accuracy â€“ comparing CO2 ratings with actual CO2 emissions data for accuracy validation.
ðŸ”¹Emission Reduction Strategies â€“ Suggest strategies used by models with low emissions that could be adopted by other manufacturers.

ðŸš˜ Insights 
ðŸ”¹Low CO2 Emitters - Electric and hybrid models
ðŸ”¹High CO2 Emitters - High-performance and larger engine vehicles
ðŸ”¹Best Fuel Efficiency - Hybrid and electric models in city driving
ðŸ”¹Worst Fuel Efficiency - Large SUVs and trucks in city driving
ðŸ”¹Best Class Performance - Compact and subcompact cars have better smog ratings due to smaller engines.
ðŸ”¹Worst Class Performance - SUVs and trucks have worse smog ratings.
ðŸ”¹Top Models in Emission Reduction 
ðŸ”¹Rating and Emission Discrepancies - discrepancies between their CO2 ratings and actual emissions indicate potential areas for improvement in rating accuracy.

By analyzing these key metrics and insights, companies can improve their environmental footprint, meet regulatory standards, and attract environmentally-conscious consumers and policy makers.
